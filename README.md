**Virtual Virtuoso is a 2D puzzle/rhythm game that helps you learn to read and play music.** You are challenged to memorize the notes of real songs while playing along to them, progressing through the game unlocking songs of varying difficulty, from Hot Cross Buns to Für Elise. Learn to play in every sense of the word as you become a more refined musician and purveyor of the musical arts.

Developed with a small team in collaboration with Simon Fraser University over the course of nine months for a target audience of older adults aged 55+.
